# Overview

Frigg began as many products and open source projects do- a group of developers trying to solve their own or their clients needs saw common patterns and wanted to memorialize and publish the code they were re-using across projects.

As such, the first few years of Frigg development were largely driven by client projects needs, and we (Left Hook) were only able to move Frigg along in between critical paths for those individual projects. So, we're still working out the kinks in inviting contributing developers.

Rule of thumb is- if you find something you need fixed,&#x20;

* Go to the relevant repo (Core, API Module Library, Example Apps, Create Frigg App, etc.)
* Create a branch or fork from `main`
* Make your tweaks
* Submit a PR

Someone from the core maintainer team will review your code and ask questions where needed, as well as provide some guidance if any additional guidance is warranted.

There will be many more instructions in the coming months, especially as we ramp up the ability for folks to add their own API Modules to the mix, or other Frigg Adapters and Extensions.

As always, just ask, and we'll be happy to chat!
