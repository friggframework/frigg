# Overview

API Modules are the Lego bricks that make Frigg-powered integrations develop faster. An API Module is the code that wraps your target partner's API and represents that API back to Frigg.

Frigg's API Modules are available for free under the MIT license. Translation: if your target partner's logo is in this library already, Frigg just saved you many hours of work.
