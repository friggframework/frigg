# üß≠ Navigating the Docs

## Overview

These docs should be your go-to resource for all things Frigg related. Seconday are GitHub READMEs and Slack community channels.

We are attempting to embrace a [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) approach to documenting Frigg. Any recommendations are welcome!

In general, there are four main areas of the docs, and four supplemental sections

### Main Documentation Areas

^ Here you'll find Quick Start tutorials and examples, along with deeper dive documentation on how to develop integrations with Frigg. The intent here is for you to learn integration development generally and Frigg specific concepts while actually developing along with the tutorials.

^ These "How To's" are your docs to keep around as you implement certain integration features, or as you work with specific marketplaces and integration types. Think of these like checklists in the operating room for surgeons, or the checklists for airplane pilots. After your first few, you won't need, but it will be nice to have!

^ We've made a lot of trade-off decisions in building Frigg the way we have. We ought to explain ourselves. So, here's the documentation for critical decisions and concepts. This is like an FAQ but deeper.

^ This should be the most familiar for libraries and frameworks you've used in the past. Literal definitions of classes, methods, functions, enums, APIs, etc. available to you as you do your Frigg development.

### Supplemental Documentation Areas

^ Our goal is to make understanding an API you'd like to develop against _the same experience_ for every single API module in Frigg. By documenting each module in the same way, you'll know exactly where to look to find exactly what you need. No more "navigating a new set of documentation". Just straight to the point.

^ Here's where we lay out how to get involved in contributing to the Frigg core project. And oh boy are we glad to have you!

^ When it comes to Frigg-related support, you've got a few options. Hit us up in those places! Or in person any time we're at events.

^ We're using an external tool for now, so we're just linking out to there and giving a high level short-medium-long term road map on which you can anchor your expectations. Or if you want to sponsor pieces of the roadmap, you can greatly change its shape.
