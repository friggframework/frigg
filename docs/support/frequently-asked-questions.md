<summary>How does Frigg accelerate Technical Partnerships?</summary>

You should read our [Frigg Non-Technical Overview](https://frigg.lefthook.com/overview).

But TLDR:

When two partnership leaders seek to build an integration to co-market and co-sell around, their companies often struggle to muster the product management and development resources required to get a useful integration built. And as we've seen a 100 times: no tech, no partnership!

With Frigg, the development process accelerates so that the business relationship can launch and flourish faster.
