# Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you get the most out of the Frigg framework:

### API Modules

Think of API Modules as individual building blocks that let Frigg connect to various external APIs, pulling in and manipulating data.

### Integration

Integration is how Frigg hooks up with third-party services to create a smooth and cohesive user experience.

### Data Handling

Frigg manages data securely and efficiently, ensuring it can scale as needed without compromising performance.

### Customization

Frigg is highly customizable, letting you tailor modules and integrations to fit your specific needs.

### Testing

Frigg supports automated testing with tools like Jest to maintain reliability and performance.

### Contribution

Frigg is open-source and thrives on community contributions. Whether you're fixing bugs, writing documentation, or developing new modules, your input is valuable. We encourage users to get involved through our GitHub repository, participate in discussions, and submit pull requests. Every bit of help makes Frigg better for everyone.
