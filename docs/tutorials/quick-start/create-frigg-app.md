# Initialize With Create Frigg App (CFA)

### Use `npx` to Create the App

Be sure to double-check that you have all the [prerequisite tools installed](./) before attempting this tutorial.

Open your terminal and cd to a location where you want to install your Frigg application. Then run the following command to create a new Frigg app, replacing `[my-app-integrations]` with your desired app name:

```
npx create-frigg-app [my-app-integrations]
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note on naming:** We recommend naming your Frigg app something descriptive that reflects its purpose as a microservice that powers integrations; For example, "my-app-integrations" is a good fit.
{% endhint %}

Now navigate to your newly created app directory using the following command:

```
cd [my-app-integrations]
```

Congrats! You've just successfully scaffolded and installed your Frigg app. Continue with further configuration and customization.
