# Initialize With Create Frigg App

### Use `npx` to Create the App

Open your terminal and cd to a location you want to install your Frigg application, then run the following command to create a new Frigg app, replacing `[my-app-integrations]` with your desired app name:

```
npx create-frigg-app [my-app-integrations]
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note on naming:** We recommend naming your Frigg app something descriptive that reflects its purpose as a microservice that powers integrations; For example, "my-app-integrations" is a good fit.
{% endhint %}

Navigate to your newly created app directory using the following command:

```
cd [my-app-integrations]
```

Congrats! You've just successfully scaffolded and installed your Frigg application. You can now continue with further configuration and customization.
