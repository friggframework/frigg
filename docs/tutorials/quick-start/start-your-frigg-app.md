# Start Your Frigg App

Ready to see Frigg in action? Let's start it up!

Make sure you're in the root directory of your application, then use:

```
npm run start
```

Your browser should open to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see your Login screen.

Before you continue, make sure that both your frontend and backend are running. An easy way to know is to check if your terminal looks something like this:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt="Console log displaying the backend server being &#x22;ready&#x22; on localhost:3001"><figcaption><p>The terminal output shows the backend server running locally, with a list of active routes and endpoints available for testing and development</p></figcaption></figure>

If your terminal shows that the backend is also running, you can now experience with your app as an end-user and connect it to see live data coming through!
