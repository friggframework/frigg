# Quick Start Tutorial

### Getting Started

Aloha! Ready to dive into the world of Frigg? Let’s get you up and running by creating a HubSpot integration (or what HubSpot calls an "app"). This exercise will guide you through setting up a Frigg app locally, integrating it with HubSpot, and seeing the magic happen in real-time. Don’t worry if you’re not a developer, we’ve got you covered with step-by-step instructions. Let's roll!

### Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:

* [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed
* [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/)&#x20;
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and running on your machine
* A [HubSpot Developer Account](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/developers?utm\_campaign=create-frigg-app)
* Your favorite IDE installed and ready to use

### Overview

Running the `create-frigg-app` command will generate a Frigg application that, within a few minutes, is deployable to your own infrastructure accounts. Let's get started with `Create Frigg App` and unpack the magic as we go.

**What is HubSpot and why use it in our tutorial?**

HubSpot is a popular marketing and CRM tool that helps businesses manage customer interactions. In this exercise, we use HubSpot to demonstrate how Frigg connects with external APIs. Setting up a HubSpot app lets you see how to connect, authenticate, and pull data from an external service, making it a great way to learn integration basics.
