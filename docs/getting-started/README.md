# Getting Started with Frigg Framework

Welcome to the Frigg Framework! This section provides comprehensive getting started guides for each supported frontend framework and the core backend system.

## Choose Your Path

Frigg Framework supports multiple frontend frameworks, allowing you to integrate with your existing tech stack or start fresh with your preferred framework.

### üöÄ Quick Framework Selection

| Framework | Best For | Guide |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **React** | Existing React apps, component-based architecture | [React Guide](./react.md) |
| **Vue.js** | Reactive applications, composition API fans | [Vue.js Guide](./vue.md) |
| **Angular** | Enterprise applications, TypeScript-first | [Angular Guide](./angular.md) |
| **Svelte** | Performance-focused apps, minimal bundle size | [Svelte Guide](./svelte.md) |
| **Backend Only** | API-first, headless integrations | [Backend Guide](./backend-only.md) |

### üéØ Choose by Use Case

#### Building Integration Marketplace
If you're building an integration marketplace or directory for your users:
- **Recommended**: React or Vue.js for mature ecosystem and component libraries
- **Start with**: [React Guide](./react.md) or [Vue.js Guide](./vue.md)

#### Enterprise Integration Management
If you're building internal integration management tools:
- **Recommended**: Angular for enterprise features and TypeScript
- **Start with**: [Angular Guide](./angular.md)

#### High-Performance Integration Dashboard
If performance and bundle size are critical:
- **Recommended**: Svelte for optimal performance
- **Start with**: [Svelte Guide](./svelte.md)

#### API-Only Integration Service
If you only need backend integration capabilities:
- **Recommended**: Backend-only setup with optional CLI management
- **Start with**: [Backend Guide](./backend-only.md)

## Common Prerequisites

Before starting with any framework, ensure you have:

### Required Software
- **Node.js** 18+ ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** 8+ or **yarn** 1.22+ (included with Node.js)
- **Git** ([Download](https://git-scm.com/))

### Recommended Tools
- **VS Code** with Frigg extension ([Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- **Docker** for local development ([Download](https://docker.com/))
- **AWS CLI** for deployment ([Installation Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/))

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Verify Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 18+

# Verify npm version  
npm --version   # Should be 8+

# Install Frigg CLI globally
npm install -g @friggframework/devtools

# Verify installation
frigg --version
```

## Universal Concepts

Regardless of your chosen framework, you'll work with these core Frigg concepts:

### üîå Integrations
Self-contained modules that handle authentication, data exchange, and business logic for specific third-party services (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack).

### üèóÔ∏è Core Framework
The backend engine (`@friggframework/core`) that provides:
- Authentication management
- Data encryption and security
- Integration lifecycle management
- Serverless deployment capabilities

### üé® UI Frameworks
Frontend packages that provide framework-specific components and utilities:
- `@friggframework/ui-react` - React components and hooks
- `@friggframework/ui-vue` - Vue composables and components  
- `@friggframework/ui-angular` - Angular services and components
- `@friggframework/ui-svelte` - Svelte stores and components

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools
CLI and development utilities (`@friggframework/devtools`) for:
- Project scaffolding
- Local development server
- Deployment management
- Integration testing
