# Frontend Template

## Environment variables

These environment variables are required (by default the backend runs locally on port 3001):

```bash
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3001/dev"
```

To facilitate running locally, copy `.env.example` to `.env` (which is gitignored)

## To start using the project, install dependencies and start the webserver locally

`npm install`

`npm run start`
