# API Module Library Moved for v1
To help simplify the release tooling 🛠️, as well as anticipating a dramatic increase 📈 in the number of API modules over the 
lifespan of this project, we have moved the [api-module-library 📂 directory to its own repo](https://github.com/friggframework/api-module-library) with its own release tooling.

If you're currently using a v0 version of Frigg and/or a Frigg API Module, check out the `version-0` branch. Any updates
you'd like to make to v0 items can be made by cutting a new branch from `version-0` and submitting a PR there, with the
corresponding `labels` of `release` and whatever semver you're looking for (Note, only `patch` and `minor` will be accepted)

Thanks for taking a look at the project, and looking forward to your contribution! Please don't hesitate to reach out
by any means you know how 😁
