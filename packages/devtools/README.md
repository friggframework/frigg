# Frigg Framework Devtools

This package contains development tools and utilities for the Frigg Framework, an open-source serverless framework designed to simplify the development of integrations at scale.

## Contents

The devtools package includes the following main components:

1. Frigg CLI
2. Migrations
3. Test Utilities

## Frigg CLI

The Frigg CLI is a command-line interface tool that helps developers manage and install API modules in their Frigg projects.

### Key Features

- Install API modules
- Search for available API modules
- Automatically update project files
- Handle environment variables
- Validate package existence and backend paths

### Usage

To use the Frigg CLI, run the following command:
```sh
frigg install <api-module-name>
```

This command will search for the specified API module, install it, and update your project accordingly.

## Migrations

(Add information about migrations here if available)

## Test Utilities

The test directory contains utilities to assist with testing in the Frigg Framework.

### Key Features

- Integration validator (TODO: implementation details to be added)
- Mock API functionality

### Mock API

The `mock-api.js` file provides functionality to mock API responses for testing purposes. It uses `nock` for HTTP request interception and includes features like:

- Caching of authentication tokens
- Recording and replaying of HTTP requests
- Jest test state management

Usage example:

```javascript
const { mockApi } = require('@friggframework/devtools/test/mock-api');

// Use mockApi in your tests to simulate API responses
```
