**Frigg** is a **Framework** that powers **direct/native integrations** between your product and external software partners.

Build enterprise-grade integrations as simply as _`create-frigg-app`_.

## The Vision for the Framework and the Community
Imagine a world where you can spin up an integration requested by your customers, product team, or partnership folk within a matter of minutes, and push to production within a day.
Imagine that you get a notification whenever one of APIs you rely on has been updated, and less than a day later you get a 
second notification telling you your integration service is ready for a version bump with the new updates incorporated and tested.

And now imagine all of this is running on your own accounts.

That's our vision for Frigg. Learn more at <a href="https://friggramework.org/">FriggFramework.org</a>


## Background
Software integrations have been a problem developers have been asked to solve since the very first "hello world." It's not new.
However, in almost all cases, the most we could do was build our own homespun solution, read the API docs of our desired
integration target, and then forever maintain and hope we built a repeatable process. This cost time and labor, and a headache.
Developers spent time learning an API to only ever use it once. Maintaining the integrations over time becomes a headache.
Each one has a risk of becoming its own special time suck in the organization.

Yet every integration has the potential to deliver tremendous value to your end users and therefore to you as the software
provider.

At <a href="https://lefthook.com/">Left Hook</a> we found that not only were we recreating the wheel for every project,
we were also highly incentivized to learn an API and double down on that knowledge for any and all comers. We looked across
the market, and providers who were trying to solve this problem either created vendor lock-in with an integrations-as-subscription
model, or the open source options required spinning up expensive servers and immediately became deeply technical.

At the same time, over the past decade plus, major cloud providers started creating serverless options that unlock the perfect
use case for integrations.

- Low to no cost to have "at ready"
- Low to no server management
- Highly Scalable to tackle large request volumes with the same logic/code that handles single requests
- Infrastructure-as-code solutions like the serverless.com framework that allow for cloud agnostic architecture with the promise of fully managed infra

So, enter Frigg. We built what you would build, if you had the time to review hundreds or thousands of APIs and build a framework
flexible enough to handle any workflow or use case thrown at it, able to scale from two to two million records passing through the pipes.
