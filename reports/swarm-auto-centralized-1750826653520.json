  "objective": "Help me research and write, using SAFLA wherever it makes sense, a migration approach to /Users/sean/Documents/GitHub/create-frigg-app where we want to basically subsume that into the frigg cli as a potential frigg init or frigg create command. In addition, we are trying to be more clear on what we're building with frigg, and adding a frontend directory has led to a lot of confusion. We want a base frigg app to be a backend service, with some optional frontend components, but the intent being that the adopter incorporates the frigg service into their existing full stack application. We want the frigg ui library to be available in various bindings (React, vue, svelte, webkit, etc) and want to have some demo repos where people can see how to incorporate frigg into a live application. However, with frigg init or create command, we want to be a pure production-ready repo and frigg application. Instead, whe want to take some parts of the current create-frigg-app template and frontend, and turn it into what we're currently calling the 'frigg local management GUI'. The idea is that the gui is part of devtools, and would be a command like frigg ui or frigg manage, and it would basically be a frigg command center for developing and testing a frigg project/application. It should static read off of the repo, and provide a few tools to the user/developer to use. For one, it should tie into the frigg CLI. For another, it would be a cool way to discover and add a new integration to the mix. And for another, it would be a way to exercise and test the integrations locally. There are a few key nuances to watch out for. First, we should be able to let hte user 'start' the application and then show what a user would see. Second, we should let the frigg developer create a dummy 'user' by providing the app user id and app org id as input fields. third, we should allow the developer user to select or manage the connections (entities) for each of the integrations. THere is some work we need to do on the frigg API and the corresponding UI such that we can allow 'end users' or in our case the frigg developer to connect and manage their connected accounts separate from creating the itnegration using those accounts. Anyway, the goal is to have the basic user available to mimic with a lightweight ui implementation what might be happening inside the actual adopter's app. The other thing we could do witht he management ui is plug into a live production instance to get stats, and show a basic dashboard of how many onnected users there are etc... the goal would be that our local management GUI would use the frigg ui library wherever it made senes, but otherwise would be its own app running. I want to make sure it's super clear that this is a management GUI, and when we're running things live. We should also consider allowing the frigg developer to use the GUI to add things to an integration, which itself woudl just call the frigg CLI and update the code accordingly... please consider all of this and turn it into a robust PRD and task list that we will use to update our devtools package and frigg cli, and eventually sunset/delete the create-frigg-app repo and comamnd.",
